This can be seen in the figure below showing the cicular velcoties for the two potentials."

    "In this first simulation I didn't add any initial velocity or external potential. I had a difficult time getting the system to remain bound. I think this might be due to my initial distribution which I chose to be radomly sampled in (r,$\\theta$) space. The problem with this is that it does not translate into random sampling in (x,y) space so there is a higher density of test particles nearer the centre. This high density at the centre makes it more likely for a test particle to interact with other particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "These interations cause particles to gradually gain energy until they have enough kinetic energy to escape the system. The remaining particles are then less bound to the system, and gradually more and more particles can escape the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I set the system to initially start with no kinetic energy it follows that virial theorem will try to establish an equilibrium between the potential and the kinetic energy by having the particles acclerated to velocities in which $V\\approx 2K$. \n",

    "Conclusion: If I were to have more time to work on this I would first fool around with my initial phase space distribution. At the very least I could try to use the virial theorem to choose initial velcoties that roughly balance the total potential energy of the sytem. Another way to improve the simulation would be to sample particle locations using a density distribution that is realistic rather than a simple uniform (in r and $\\theta$) distribution. Something like the Kuzmin disk $\\rho$ could be used to sample the locations of the test particles in 2D modelling baryonic matter, while the $\\rho$ for the NFW potetential could be used to set initial locations of model dark matter test particles for modelling the halo in 3D.
